I am adding the link in the readme file since my Model - best_fire_detection_model.pkl file is **460.1 MB**. Any file larger than 25 MB is not accepted in the Github without LFS.
Students, you can also share the link in the github just like I did. If you don't know how to create the readme file, you can download my readme file and edit it.

Link for the Model:
